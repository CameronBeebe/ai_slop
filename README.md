A collection of some scripts and code from experimenting with LLM code generation.

Most of these were "one shot" generated stand alone scripts. They are also not comprehensive, in the sense that I have generated much more functional code for specific personal or non-standalone purposes.

Various models:

grok-3
gemini diffusion
gemini 2.5
claude
